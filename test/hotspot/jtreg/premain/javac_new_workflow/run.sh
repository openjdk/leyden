# This is a new propsed workflow for the "terminal stage" of the Leyden
# condenser pipeline (see https://openjdk.org/projects/leyden/notes/03-toward-condensers)
#
# The CDS and AOT artifacts are generated in a single step.
#
# Please run this script and look at the commands in the generated cmds.txt file.

# Usage:
#
# bash run.sh $JAVA
# bash run.sh $JAVA args ....
#
# e.g.
#
# bash.sh /jdk3/bld/le4/images/jdk/bin/java
# bash.sh /jdk3/bld/le4/images/jdk/bin/java -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:-AOTInvokeDynamicLinking

# These options are enabled by default for training run. You can either disable them in the command-line
# as shown above, or edit the following line
#
# The training run uses two JVM processes. We add "pid" to the log to distinguish their output.
TRAINING_OPTS="${TRAINING_OPTS} -Xlog:scc -Xlog:cds=debug::uptime,tags,pid"
TRAINING_OPTS="${TRAINING_OPTS} -XX:+AOTClassLinking"
#TRAINING_OPTS="${TRAINING_OPTS} -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+RecordTraining"

# These options are enabled by default for training run.
#PRODUCTION_OPTS="${PRODUCTION_OPTS} -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:+ReplayTraining"
